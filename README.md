This is a copy of a group assignment done for our Master's in Business Analytics and Management. The folder inside consists of a README file which explains what the project was about and the locations of desired pieces of code. Due to privacy reasons, the exactred pieces of data have been removed, however the code used to extract the said data is still present.
